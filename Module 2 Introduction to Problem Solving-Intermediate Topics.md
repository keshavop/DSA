> 1. Check the no. of 0th(zero) bit
> 2. count the no. of set bits
> 3. Check a number is a power of 2 or not

## Day 11 Arrays & Dynamic Arrays

> 1. Sort entire array
> 2. Reverse entire array
> 3. Subarray
> 4. Reverse subarray
> 5. Rotate entire array
> 6. Max subarray sum

## Day 12 Multidimensional Arrays

> 4. Count no of set bits from 1 to N

## Day 14 Problem on Arrays
> 1. Subsequence
- Given a string s, containing only lowercase characters, determine how many subsequences exist.

> 2. Closet Min - Max
- Given an array find the length of smaller sub array which contains both min and max elements of array within subarray

> 3. Max length consecutive 1's
- Given a binary string of length N. It is allowd to do almost ! swap between 0 and 1.
- The task is to find the length of the longest consecutive 1's that can be achieved.


## Day 15 Introduction to Hashing
> 1. Find frequency of numbers
- given N array elements and Q queries, for each query find the frequency of each element in array

> 2. Find the first non-repeating element
> 3. Find the intersection of 2 arrays (Both arrays will have distinct elements)
> 4. Given N array elements find number of distinct elements
> 5. Given N array elements check if there exists a pair(i,j) such that i!=j (arr[i]+arr[j]=k)


## Day 16 Hashing Problems
> 1. Given N array elements check if there exists a pair(i,j) such that i!=j (arr[i]+arr[j]=k)
> 2. Given N array elements E and queries for every query (i,j) find sum of all elements in given range (i<=j) [Subarray]
> 3. Given N array elements, check if there exists a sub array with sum=0
> 4. Given N array elements, How many subarrays with sum = k
> 5. Given N array elements, get no of aub array with k odd numbers
> 6. [Anagram] 2 strings A &  are said to be anagrams of each other if they are permutation of each other.
> 7. given 2 strings A & B get how many sub-strings of A are an anagram of B [HARD]
> 8. given N array element check if all are distinct?
> 9. validate a Sudoko

***

## Day 20 Hashing Doubts
> 1. [Anagram] 2 strings A &  are said to be anagrams of each other if they are permutation of each other.
> 2. Is Dictionary
- arrange words or strings in dictionary order
> 3. Colourful numbers
- given an array of N elements, check if product of each subarray distinct
> 4. Given N array elements check the following:
- we need to have only 2 distinct numbers
- both distinct elements should have same frequency

***

## Day 21 Problem Solving 2
> 1. prefix sum
> 2.Pick from both sides [AMAZON]
-given an array arr[N] we pick B elements from either left or right end of an array. Find the return max possible sum.
- Note: At each turn we can pick an element either from Right end or Left end.
- Find max possible sum
> 3.Given an arr[n] construct left[] and right []
-left[] should contain max of elements from[0,i]
-right[] should contain max of elements from[i,N-1]
> 4. Rain water trapping
> 5.
> 6. Given an arr[N], it contains all the elements from [1,N+1] except 1 element, find the missing element.
